This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in CSS when using the `content` property. Improper use of this property can lead to unexpected layout or rendering behavior.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The problem is primarily associated with incorrect syntax, especially when attempting to insert URLs or complex strings as content.
