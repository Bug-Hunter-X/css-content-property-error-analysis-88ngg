The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if you use it incorrectly, or attempt to insert content that's too complex, it can lead to unexpected rendering issues or even complete layout failure.  For example, using an invalid selector within the `content` property will fail silently.  A common error is forgetting to use quotes around strings, or using incorrect URL syntax for image insertion.
